# options: 'sample', or path to directory containing reference tables. The path is relative to the source path, e.g. the absolute path is "/content/input/data_a/reference_folder" and the subdirectories containing the tables are located in source =  "/content/input/data_a", then the string specifying the path is given as 'reference_folder'. 
ref_fraction = 1  
# ref_fraction is the fraction of all existing directories (containting tables) 
that will be used to determine the reference schema for the Parquet file.
 The motivation behind this is the following: The writer is opened once and
  closed only after all files have been added. 
 However, opening it requires the specification of the table schema, 
 which then cannot be changed anymore 
 (unless the writing process is terminated - then the Parquet file can be read and modified).
  That means that we need to preset a schema to which all tables can be converted.
  Specifically that means that the types need to chosen such that conversion 
  will most likely not result in loss and that all columns should be present. 
  To support this, we iterate through a list of table paths, 
  sampled uniformly random as a fraction of all existing tables (of a given type).
  We then determine the widest table, which serves as a boilerplate reference table.
  We determine that reference table for every table type and store its path in a dictionary.
# options : any rational number in [0,1]

type_conversion = int2float 
# Once we collected all reference table paths, we load each table and 
perform the specified type conversion. This is an operation that will be performed
 on every table that is written to the Parquet file. For the purpose of opening the writer,
we however just need the schema from the pyarrow table generated from the dataframe that is
 loaded from the path that we stored in our reference directory.
